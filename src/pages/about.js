    <h1>Who is Jessica?</h1>
    <p>
      Being a career-changer, Jessica has worn many hats. Not in the literal
      sense. She is very excited when she finds something she likes and is
      effective, meaning she has had the same winter hat since 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      But back to job hats. There are the radio station gigs, both on-air and
      producing PSAs and commercials. Playing cello with guitar friends who were
      in awe of the cello. Interning at a record company in Nashville, TN. Did
      you know that interning can also show a person what they do not want to do
      as a job? It's true.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are the various barista experiences, both corporate coffee and small
      tourist town with a line out the door for hours types of experiences.
      Temping at an insurance company, which led to a Mountain Dew addiction
      because 40 hours a week of inputting payments into a DOS system needs
      excitement somewhere, somehow.
    </p>
    <p>But wait. There's more.</p>
    <p>
      Working for the University of Tennessee. Cleaning houses for high-end
      clients. Photography assistant. Slinging supplements in a small-town
      health store. Working on multiple farms. Helping build a food hub that
      supported local farmers, as well as area schools and restaurants. Washing
      dishes and plating food in a cramped but fun kitchen. As well as a
      fantastic few years at a larger food co-op.
    </p>
    <p>So why software development, and why now?</p>
    <h2>Now Presenting...</h2>
    <p>
      I love learning the various perspectives of not just a job, but a system.
      Knowing your audience is guaranteed to make a person more effective at
      whatever work they are doing.

    <p>
      Websites are everywhere. Every day, it is becoming more commonplace that a
      person or company needs a well-functioning website, whether it is
      customer-facing, or internal.

      I will dare say that I am not necessarily passionate about code,
      specifically. But I am absolutely passionate about learning, growing, and
      making things easier for others. Code is a vehicle to do that for millions
      of people. All of those zeros and ones, somehow, allow you to read these
      words right now on a laptop? iPad? Tablet? Phone? TV screen? It is
      absolutely incredible.
